							<p>
								I have started my studies at Webster University in Tashkent on 13th of January, 2020.
								During my studies, I have learnt Financial and Managerial Accounting, Microeconomics and Macroeconomics while also learning prorgamming. 
								I had taken two computer courses as electives which were focused on C++ while I was studying for my Economics degree.
								This lead me to learn about programming more and later to enroll in Computer Science degree.
							</p>
							<p>
								After finishing my Economics degree, I was determined to continue my studies in CS, therefore, I have started my CS studies from August 2023. 
								This was the best decision I have made! During my CS year, I have learnt Network Principles, Cybersecurity Essentials, Data Principles, and Operating Systems.
